<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Jonathan Lieberman. I am currently a Data Science Consultant at Accenture. I work with many clients to help unlock the value of their data through the use of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning. Recently, I have been developing my DevOps and cloud skills across the major cloud platforms. I enjoy working with these technologies because my passion comes from automating work and providing accessibility for everyone to benefit from technology.</p>
<p>I am also a huge sports fan. I grew up playing many sports, and swam DI at Northwestern.</p>
